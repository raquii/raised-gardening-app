            &#123; RAISED &#125; is a raise-bed, square-foot garden planning application. Users can create new gardens or edit existing ones, as well as look up a variety of plants that thrive in such environments.

                Using &#123; RAISED &#125; is easy: select 'Create a New Garden' on the homepage, input a name and dimentions for your garden, and get planting. If you need to look up information about a certain plant, check out the 'Plant-pedia' to learn everything from spacing to how to harvest your produce.

            &#123; RAISED &#125; was created using React, Ruby with ActiveRecord and Rack. It was designed by me, Raquel Rom√°n-Rodriguez, as a project for FlatIron School of Software Engineering's program. You can view the source code for the project here:
